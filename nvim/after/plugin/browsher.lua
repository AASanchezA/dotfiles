    ---
    --- Each provider is a table with the following keys:
    --- - `url_template`: The URL template, where `%s` are placeholders.
    ---   The placeholders are, in order:
    ---   1. Remote URL
    ---   2. Branch or tag
    ---   3. Relative file path
    --- - `single_line_format`: Format string for a single line (e.g., `#L%d`).
    --- - `multi_line_format`: Format string for multiple lines (e.g., `#L%d-L%d`).
    ---
    --- Example:
    --- ```lua
    --- providers = {
    ---   ["mygit.com"] = {
    ---     url_template = "%s/src/%s/%s",
    ---     single_line_format = "?line=%d",
    ---     multi_line_format = "?start=%d&end=%d",
